        MongoDB, and other NoSQL databases, are schemaless databases. This means
        that users can store unstructured data. The flexibility makes it easier
        to store data, yet also makes it more difficult to organize your data.

        Differences between sql and nosql databases.
      </h3>
      <p>
        SQL is primarily called RDBMS or Relational Databases whereas NoSQL is a
        Non-relational or Distributed Database. Comparing SQL vs NoSQL database,
        SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases can be
        document based, key-value pairs, graph databases. SQL databases are
        vertically scalable while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL
        databases have a predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases use dynamic
        schema for unstructured data. Comparing NoSQL vs SQL performance, SQL
        requires specialized DB hardware for better performance while NoSQL uses
        commodity hardware.

        What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work
      </h3>
      <p>
        JWT are mainly used for authentication. After a user logs in to an
        application, the application will create a JWT and send it back to the
        user. Subsequent requests by the user will include the JWT. The token
        tells the server what routes, services, and resources the user is
        allowed to access.
